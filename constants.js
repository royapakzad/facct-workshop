export const WORKSHOP_ABSTRACT = `Humanitarian and government agencies increasingly rely on generative AI chatbots to deliver critical information to refugees, asylum seekers, and other displaced populations. However, most systems are designed, fine-tuned, and benchmarked through an English-centric lens, sometimes missing the linguistic, cultural, and legal nuances important for real-world safety in multilingual communities.
This interactive CRAFT workshop will begin with an overview of current chatbot deployment in humanitarian contexts and present how language inconsistencies and inadequate multilingual moderation can lead to harmful outcomes.
Participants then engage in a hands-on "mini-lab" exercise, working to probe LLMs across language pairs. Each person/team selects an English scenario from our curated list of refugee and migration-related issues, then chooses and refines the translated version of that prompt to ensure accuracy before testing it on a selected LLM. Finally, participants evaluate responses using a human rights-aware rubric and analyze inconsistencies between language pairs.`;
