export const WORKSHOP_ABSTRACT = `Humanitarian and government agencies are increasingly deploying generative AI chatbots to provide critical information to refugees, asylum seekers, and other displaced populations. Yet many of these tools are developed and evaluated primarily in English, often overlooking the linguistic, cultural, and legal nuances essential for safe and equitable access across diverse communities.

This virtual, hands-on CRAFT session invites participants to explore a publicly accessible web-based evaluation platform that allows users to interact with multilingual LLMs and assess their responses through a human rights lens. After a brief introduction to the real-world deployment of AI chatbots in humanitarian settings, participants will independently navigate to the online "mini-lab" to complete an interactive exercise.

Users will select a scenario from a curated list of refugee and migration-related topics, choose and refine the translated version of the prompt, and test it on a selected large language model (LLM). They will then evaluate the chatbot responses using a human rights-centered rubric and compare outputs across language pairs to identify inconsistencies, tone shifts, factual gaps, and potential safety concerns.

The tool can be accessed during or after the session, enabling flexible, real-time experimentation and exploration. No technical background is required—only a commitment to multilingual equity and inclusive evaluation in AI.`;
